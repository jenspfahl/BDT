This is a handy timer that lets you set notifications ("breaks") during the timer's duration.

Imagine this scenario: You have 45 minutes for a walk and should return halfway through.
So, set the timer duration to 45 minutes, define a break at the halfway point, and start the timer.
You will now receive a notification (audio, vibration, device notification) once the halfway point is reached,
AND, of course, when the entire time has elapsed.

Other scenarios include notifications every 15 minutes to keep track of the elapsed and remaining time.
Or to receive notifications shortly before the timer expires.

The notifications are coded as audio signals and/or vibrations so you can recognize the breaks without having to look at the display.
The pattern is very simple: A short beep means "1," a long beep means "5." "Beeeeep beep," for example, means "6."
All signals begin with a short "bep-bep" sequence to attract your attention.

Thanks to the audio and vibration patterns, you'll be notified of the timer's progress without having to take your smartphone out of your pocket.
This is especially convenient during workouts or other outdoor activities.
